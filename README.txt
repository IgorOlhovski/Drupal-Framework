Created by Andr√© Griffin

Framework is a blank canvas for theme developers. 
Use Framework as a user friendly starting point to help facilitate your theme development. 
Build site themes without feeling like you have to reinvent the wheel or remove unnecessary code every time.

Framework 3 is intended to be used with the "Seven" administration theme included with Drupal 7.

To fully convert Framework to your own custom theme, it is encouraged that you: 
 - Copy the 'framework' directory in sites/all/themes/ and rename it as 'yourthemename' 
 - Change the filename and contents of the .info file accordingly
 - Use find/replace in template.php to replace 'framework' with 'yourthemename' 
 - Upload and enable the theme
 - Modify as needed

To create a sub-theme based on Framework, see: http://drupal.org/node/225125
