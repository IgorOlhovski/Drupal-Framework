Drupal 6 Framework theme
Created by Andre Griffin



Framework is a blank canvas for theme developers. Use Framework as a starting point to help facilitate your theme development.
Features

    * The Framework theme gives general placement and formatting to basic Drupal elements.
    * Fixed width by default. Main column resizes between two-column and three-column layouts.
    * CSS file is organized by section and main selectors are already in place.
    * The administration section is stripped out of the default Garland theme.

Framework is not intended to be used as is. Please edit freely.



Install to sites/all/themes
