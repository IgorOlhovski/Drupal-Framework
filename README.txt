Drupal 5 Framework theme
Created by Andre Griffin > user andregriffin


Framework is a blank canvas for theme developers. Use Framework as a starting point to help facilitate your theme development.

Features

    * The Framework theme gives general placement and formatting to basic Drupal elements.
    * Fixed width of 960px by default. Main column resizes between two-column and three-column layouts.
    * CSS file is highly organized, including a table of contents, color codes, section flags, alphabetical properties, etc.
    * Includes a list of CSS utility classes for easy content formatting
    * W3C valid CSS 2.1 / XHTML 1.0 Strict
    * Verified and tested with Firefox 3, Firefox 2, IE7, IE6, Safari 3
    * Search in sidebar (as a block) and header (as a theme configuration option)
    * Clean and simplified code and file structure
    * Works nicely in mobile browsers
    * The administration section is adapted from the default Garland theme.

Framework is not intended to be everything to everyone. It is built with simplicity and ease of modification in mind.

Although is not necessarily intended, Framework can be used as is if you so choose.
